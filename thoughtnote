I made a website using html, css, and bootrap which consists of information about four cricketers
I create differnt pages for differnt cricketer.

index.html:
I used inline css as well as bootstrap framework for styling the navbar.
it consist of home, profile dropdown and logout.
I also add three page carousel consist of different images related to cricket. If we click on any image in it it will redirect to the "about.html"
then I create 4 different cards. One for sachin, one for Virat, one for Rohit, one for Suryakumar.
I add hover effect to them. 
If we tab to the button, it will redirect to the more information about the respective cricketer.

sachin.html:
this page consist of information about Sachin Tendulkar which has personal information, career highlights and achievements.
It has a navbar.  for the  more styling I use inline css 

similary I used this for Virat.html, Rohit.html and surya.html
