# Cricketers_bootstrap

I made a website using HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap which consists of information about four cricketers
I create differnt pages for differnt cricketer.

index.html:
I used inline CSS as well as a bootstrap framework for styling the navbar.
it consists of home, profile dropdown, and logout.
I also added a three-page carousel consisting of different images related to cricket. If we click on any image in it it will redirect to the "about.html"
then I created 4 different cards. One for Sachin, one for Virat, one for Rohit, one for Suryakumar.
I added a hover effect to them. 
If we click on the button, it will redirect to more information about the respective cricketer.

sachin.html:
this page contains information about Sachin Tendulkar which includes personal information, career highlights, and achievements.
It has a navbar.  for more styling, I use inline CSS 

Similarly, I used this for Virat.html, Rohit.html, and Surya.html
